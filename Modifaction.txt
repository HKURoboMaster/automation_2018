The raising mechanism includes the following parts: 
 a. receiving: receive the control signal from dbus_buff and store it into the
corresponding variable;
 b. enclose the receiving function into the interactive function, where not
only the signal receiving but also the state transfer will be done;
 c. call the interactive function to update all the values. 

What value is necessary? 
Output: 0----stay; 1----up; -1----down;
Signal:
 Up	  0/1
 Down	  0/1
 ToBottom 0/1
 ToTop	  0/1
    These four values are stored in an array, and to search them, use the
following const:
 UP		0
 DOWN		1
 TOBOTTOM	2
 TOTOP		3
Status:
 Error/Offline		 0
 Bottom staying		 1
 Not bottom staying	-1
 Continuousely raising	 2
 Continuousely lowering	-2
 One-time raising	 3
 One-time lowering	-3

Variable preparation: 
Const: UP/DOWN/TOBOTTOM/TOTOP
       Status representative enum
 Defined in remote_ctrl.h
Structure defination: hero_frame
 Defined in remote_ctrl.h
Instance of hero_frame: 
 Declared in remote_ctrl.c
 Referred in get_interactive.c and info_get_task.c as an external variable

Part a-1 receiving from rc: 
This will get the info from the dbus and store it into the structure:
hero_frame
The last two signals (an array) is updated, i.e. TOTOP and TOBOTTOM
function name: remote_ctrl_hero_frame()
Defined in remote_ctrl.c, line 149
Declared in remote_ctrl.h. line 118
Called in info_interactive.c: get_frame_info()

Part a-2 receiving from keyboard:
This will get the info from the debus[keyboard_field] and store it into the
structre is the mouse_key control is in used
The 4 signals (the array) is updated.
function name: keyboard_hero_frame()
Defined in keyboard.c, line 287
Declared in keyboard.h, line 127
Called in info_interactive.c: get_frame_info()

Part b interactive:
This will call the receiving part and then conduct the state tranfer, so that
the output can be generated.
function name: get_frame_info() 
The status and the output are to be updated.
Defined in info_interactive.c, line 518
Declared in info_interactive.h, line 36
Called in info_get_task.c

Part c Updating:
Call the function get_frame_info() so that the output is generated, updated
and ready for furture usage. 
The get_frame_info() is called in info_get_task.c, line 64.

Final Part: 
Call the send_linear_actuator_mesg with the parameter frame_ctrl.output in
info_get_task.c at line 68. The function is defined in info_interactive.c
starting at line 641. This function calls the functions for writing signals to
GPIO pins. The GPIO pins are defined in main.h and are configured in gpio.h. 
Before put the hero in use: 
1. adjust the system configuration
2. decomment the calling of get_frame_info() in info_get_task.c
3. decomment the first line in the get_frame_info()
4. comment the control parts for the magazine lid.
